# Arduino-Tone-Generator

The Processing GUI sends a character, depending on which button you press, through serial to the Arduino program. 'F' for Fur Elise and 'J' for Jingle bells. The "songs", if we can call them that, are just a set of instructions to play one frequency after another. Yes, it's that rudimentary. 

While the Arduino cannot process MIDI files directly, you could use an online converter to convert it into a set tone() function calls.
